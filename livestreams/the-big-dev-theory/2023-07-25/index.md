In this episode of The Big Dev Theory on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1882050229), Daniel Gallo Solutions Engineer on the TeamCity team at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) explores [JetBrains TeamCity](https://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) – a CI solution for managing complex build pipelines, and cover its various built-in integrations with AWS. We’ll do this through a realistic game-dev build pipeline, where we build and deploy a Unity game for various platforms.

Each episode, we chat with AWS partners and bring experts with specialized knowledge in various areas of technology to provide informative and engaging live streams that help developers stay up-to-date with the latest trends and tools.
